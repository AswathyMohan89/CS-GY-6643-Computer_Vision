An important goal of artificial intelligence is to equip computers with the capability to interpret visual inputs. Computer vision and scene analysis is an AI area that deals with constructing explicit, meaningful descriptions of physical objects from images. It includes many techniques from image processing, pattern recognition, geometric modeling and cognitive processing. This course introduces the many techniques and applications of computer vision and image processing.

This is an introductory course in processing grey-scale and color images --- taught at the graduate level. This course will cover both mathematical fundamentals and implementation. It will introduce students to the basic principles of processing digital signals and how those principles apply to images. The course will cover a series of basic image-processing problems including enhancement, reconstruction, segmentation, and feature detection. Assignments will include several projects with software implementations and analysis of real data.

Prerequisites: Graduate standing, CS 5403 and MA 2012, or equivalents, or instructor's permission, proficiency in programming and familiarity with matrix arithmetic.

Required textbook: Milan Sonka, Vaclav Hlavac and Roger Boyle, Image Processing, Analysis, and Machine Vision, 4th Edition, Cengage Learning, Stamford, CT, 2015. This book is available as eTextbook, hardcover or paperback.
